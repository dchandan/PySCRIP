      This directory contains some grid files in netCDF format
      for use in the SCRIP remapping package.

      In addition, there are several source codes for creating
      netCDF files for use in SCRIP:

      convertPOPT.f  - converts input grid files for the POP 
                       ocean model to SCRIP netCDF format

      convertgauss.f - creates a SCRIP netCDF grid file for
                       a Gaussian lat/lon grid that a global
                       spectral model would use

      convert_old.f  - converts old grid files from a previous
                       version of the SCRIP routines

      myconvertPOPT.f- A variant on convertPOPT which is used to
                       generate the POP grid for the CESM model. I
                       (Deepak) do not know who wrote the code or
                       why a variant was necessary. This version
                       just happens to exist in one of my SCRIP
                       source codes, and I am adding it here to the
                       PySCRIP source code.
